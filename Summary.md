What are interviewers looking for in coding interviews?
- Can you analyze the problem and communicate it well with the interviewer before coding?
- Can you use the right data structure and algorithm?
- Can you tell the trade-off between different data structures and algorithms?
- Do you understand the time and space complexity of your solution?
- Do you know object-oriented programming and can you write your code that way?
- Can you write code in a concise and efficient way? Can you finish the code on time? 30 min for one main question and another follow-up.
- Can you write test case, including all edge cases/normal cases?

If at the same time, you can make the interviewer feel like to work with you, that will be awesome!
