Implement min Heap

min Heap in Python is a complete binary tree (missing nodes only in the last level)
"""
"""
How is Min Heap represented ?
A Min Heap is a Complete Binary Tree. A Min heap is typically represented as an array. 
The root element will be at Arr[0]. For any ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:

    Arr[(i -1) / 2] returns its parent node.
    Arr[(2 * i) + 1] returns its left child node.
    Arr[(2 * i) + 2] returns its right child node.

    parent i --- 0, left child --- 1, right child --- 2
    child ---- 1 or 2, parent --- 0

    getMin(): It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
    extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
    insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

child node value <= parent node value
